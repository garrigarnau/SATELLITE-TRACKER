# SATELLITE-TRACKER

## About the Project

**SATELLITE-TRACKER** is a simple web application built to track satellites, visualize their orbits, and provide information such as visibility and orbital details. This project was created as a **learning exercise** to explore the fundamentals of **React** and **JavaScript** while experimenting with integrating third-party APIs.

By working on this project, I aimed to learn more about:

- Building interactive components with **React**.
- Consuming APIs in real-time.
- Enhancing UI/UX design for web applications.

This is not a production-ready application but a fun and educational project.

## Features

- **Satellite List:** Browse satellites visible from a specific location.
- **Visual Passes:** Find out when satellites are visible in the sky.
- **Orbit Visualization:** View the satellite's path around Earth.
- **Simple and Clear UI:** Built with beginner-friendly components and responsive design.

   cd SATELLITE-TRACKER
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Your API Key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your N2YO API key:
     ```
     REACT_APP_N2YO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Future Plans

As this is a learning project, future improvements may include:

- Adding interactive maps to display satellite locations in real-time.
- Allowing users to save preferences (e.g., favorite satellites).
- Optimizing performance for handling large datasets.
